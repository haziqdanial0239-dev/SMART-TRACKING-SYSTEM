Which project phase has the highest cost and why?
The highest cost is during the Model Development phase because it requires extensive computational resources, high-performance hardware, and time to train and fine-tune the model effectively.

How could you reduce costs without affecting quality?
Costs can be reduced by using open-source frameworks and academic or free-tier cloud services, as well as optimizing model parameters to shorten training time without sacrificing performance.

How does resource allocation influence your schedule and overall success?
Efficient resource allocation ensures that each task is completed on time, prevents delays during model training, and helps maintain a steady workflow, which contributes to the overall success of the project.
