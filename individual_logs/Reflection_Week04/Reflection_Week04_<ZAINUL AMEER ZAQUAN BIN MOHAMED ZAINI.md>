1.Which phase of your project had the most subtasks? 
The Model Training phase had the most subtasks because it involved data preprocessing, model selection, parameter tuning, and multiple training iterations.
2.How did breaking tasks down help you plan better? 
Breaking the tasks down helped me plan better by allowing me to focus on one step at a time and track progress more easily.
3.What would you adjust in your project schedule next week?
Next week, I would adjust my schedule to allocate more time for Testing & Validation to ensure the model performs well on unseen data.
