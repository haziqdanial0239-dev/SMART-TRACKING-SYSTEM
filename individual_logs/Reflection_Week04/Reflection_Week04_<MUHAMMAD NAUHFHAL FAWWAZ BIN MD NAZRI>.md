• Which phase of your project had the most subtasks?
The greatest number of subtasks took place in the Model Development and Training stage. This stage involved data cleaning, feature selection, model training, tuning the model, and testing accuracy. 

• How did breaking tasks down help you plan better?
Breaking the work down into smaller tasks allowed for a clearer understanding of what was to be done first and improved my time management and measuring my progress over time.

• What would you adjust in your project schedule next week?
For the upcoming week, I am planning to complete the dashboard and do a early demonstration.
