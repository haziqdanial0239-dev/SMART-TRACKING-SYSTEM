# Project Scope Document

## Objectives
The Smart Tracking System aims to enhance project management efficiency by automating task monitoring, analyzing progress patterns, and providing data-driven insights through AI.
Specifically, the system will:

Automatically track real-time task progress and employee performance.

Detect potential bottlenecks and forecast delays using machine learning models.

Provide AI-generated recommendations for workload balancing and scheduling improvements.

Deliver visual insights through interactive dashboards to support managerial decisions.

## Deliverables
The project will produce the following tangible outputs:

Functional Web Application – Smart task tracking system with integrated AI analysis module.

Machine Learning Models – Trained models for predicting task completion times and identifying anomalies.

Database System – Centralized storage for task data, user activities, and performance metrics.

Interactive Dashboard – Visualization interface (via Power BI / Streamlit / Dash) displaying progress, risks, and performance analytics.

Documentation –

System Design Report (architecture, data flow, and AI models)

User Manual (guidelines for team members and managers)

Evaluation Report (accuracy, usability, and performance metrics).

## Stakeholders
Users: Project managers, team leaders, and team members who monitor and manage tasks.

Clients: Academic evaluators or organizations interested in task management solutions.

Team Roles:

Project Manager – Oversees project development and task distribution.

AI Developer – Designs and trains the AI model for task tracking and prediction.

System Developer – Builds the system interface and integrates AI components.

Data Analyst – Prepares and evaluates datasets for AI model accuracy.
